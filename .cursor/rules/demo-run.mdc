# Terminal Windows Setup for Hyperview Demo

```yaml
terminalWindows:
  - name: "Hyperview Sync"
    command: "yarn sync"
    directory: "."
    openInNewWindow: true
    executeCommand: true
  - name: "Demo Server"
    command: "yarn server"
    directory: "./demo"
    openInNewWindow: true
    executeCommand: true
  - name: "Demo iOS"
    command: "yarn ios"
    directory: "./demo"
    openInNewWindow: true
    executeCommand: true
  - name: "Demo Android"
    command: "adb reverse tcp:8085 tcp:8085 && yarn android"
    directory: "./demo"
    openInNewWindow: true
    executeCommand: true
```

# How to Run the Demo

This configuration sets up the necessary terminal windows:
1. "Hyperview Sync" - Keeps demo app in sync with source changes
2. "Demo Server" - Builds XML and hosts local demo server
3. "Demo iOS" - Runs Expo demo app for iOS (preferred platform)
4. "Demo Android" - Alternative to iOS for Android testing
5. For Android: Set up port forwarding (adb reverse tcp:8085 tcp:8085)


## Important Notes:
- The sync and server processes must be running for the demo to work
- iOS is the preferred platform for testing
- Use Android configuration only when specifically needed. Android requires setting port forwarding (adb reverse tcp:8085 tcp:8085)
- Each window will open in a new terminal window
- Wait for the sync and server processes to fully start before the mobile app will work
