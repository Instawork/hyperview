System alerts can be triggered via behaviors. The alert can display a title, message, and between 1 and 3 labeled options. Each option has other behaviors associated with it. These associated behaviors get triggered when the user selects the corresponding option.

Alerts can be used in several ways:

- To inform the user of a performed action.
- To confirm a user's action before proceeding.
- To give the user a choice of options.

Here's an example of an alert behavior used to confirm a navigation. It has two options: one which will perform the navigation, and another one to stay on the current screen.

```xml
<behavior
  xmlns:alert="https://hyperview.org/hyperview-alert"
  trigger="press"
  action="alert"
  alert:title="Continue to next screen?"
  alert:message="Are you sure you want to navigate to the next screen?"
>
  <alert:option alert:label="Navigate" href="/next" action="push" />
  <alert:option alert:label="Cancel" />
</behavior>
```

## Structure

Alert attributes and elements require their own namespace:

```html
https://hyperview.org/hyperview-alert
```

Alert behaviors are created using the standard [`<behavior>`](/docs/reference_behavior) element. To create an alert behavior, just set the `action` attribute to `"alert"`. It's usually convenient to define the XML namespace on the `<behavior>` element too:

```xml
<behavior
  xmlns:alert="https://hyperview.org/hyperview-alert"
  trigger="longPress"
  action="alert"
/>
```

Note that any standard trigger can be used, as long as it's supported by the element containing the `<behavior>`.

The alert title and description are defined as namespaced attributes on the `<behavior>` element:

```xml
<behavior
  xmlns:alert="https://hyperview.org/hyperview-alert"
  trigger="longPress"
  action="alert"
  alert:title="This is the title"
  alert:message="This is the message"
/>
```

The example above will trigger a simple alert. Since it provides no options, a single dismiss button will be included on the alert:

![no options](/img/reference_behavior_alert1.png)

Using the `<alert:option>` element, you can define up to 3 pressable options that will appear on the alert. `<alert:option>` can either contain standard [behavior attributes](/docs/reference_behavior_attributes) or [`<behavior>`](/docs/reference_behavior) child elements.

> `<alert:option>` can only respond to "press" triggers. Since this is the default trigger type, you can omit the "trigger" attribute.

If an `<alert:option>` element has no behaviors, pressing the option will dismiss the modal.

Here's an example of an alert with two options.

```xml
<behavior
  xmlns:alert="https://hyperview.org/hyperview-alert"
  trigger="longPress"
  action="alert"
  alert:title="This is the title"
  alert:message="This is the message"
>
  <alert:option alert:label="Screen 1" href="/screen1" action="push" />
  <alert:option alert:label="Screen 2" href="/screen2" action="new" />
</behavior>
```

![2 options](/img/reference_behavior_alert2.png)

Here's the same example, but using `<behavior>` elements instead. With behavior elements, multiple behaviors can be triggered in response to an option selection.

```xml
<behavior
  xmlns:alert="https://hyperview.org/hyperview-alert"
  trigger="longPress"
  action="alert"
  alert:title="This is the title"
  alert:message="This is the message"
>
  <alert:option alert:label="Screen 1">
    <behavior href="/screen1" action="push" />
  </alert:option>
  <alert:option alert:label="Screen 2">
    <behavior href="/screen2" action="new" />
  </alert:option>
</behavior>
```
